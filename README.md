# ExpenseReport
The ExpenseReport legacy code refactoring example in various languages.

This is an example of a piece of legacy code with lots of code smells.
The goal is to support the following new feature as best as you can:
* Add Lunch with an expense limit of 2000.

## Process
1. Read the code to understand what it does and how it works.
2. Read the code and check for design smells.
3. Analyze what you would have to change to implement the new requirement without refactoring the code.
4. Write a characterization test.
5. Refactor the code.
6. Test-drive the new feature.
